# sorttable
sorttable.js file in this project repository can be used by anyone to sort their html tables dynamically. 

A complete working example html table file is also added now for learning and testing puposes. 

To implement sorting in your html table files, just view the sorttable.js file here, for its instructions and then use the script/src value given below, in the head section of your html file.

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/linuxguist/sorttable@main/sorttable.js"></script>
```
